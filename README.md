# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

milestone_2 contains code which processes user input and reviews if user has provided a single alphabetical character as input.

milestone_3 builds on milestone_2 and contains functions to process guesses based on a randomly selected word from an existing list of words. 

milestone_4 integrate a class with embedded functions based on existing code in milestone_3. milestone_4 allows users to provide a single input and cross-reference if input is found in word. 

milestone_5 further builds on milestone_4 and allows the user to play Hangman and guess a random word based on a list.
